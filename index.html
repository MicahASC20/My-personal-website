    <h1>About </h1>
    <p>Hello everyone. My name is Micah Dumberger and I was born and raised in the Bronx, New York. In my family, I have my mom, dad, and my younger brother, Daniel. They always teach me different life lessons every day and that's why I appriciate them the most. In terms of my interests, my #1 interest is sports. Some sports I like include basketball, baseball and football. I would like to pursue a career in sports like an analyst, journalist, or statistician, since I'm really good at memorizing statistics. I also have a big interest in technology, which is why I applied for this All Star Code Internship. I've been interested in coding for a few years now and I wanted to see what it's like to see technology from a different angle. I've always been a fan of computers and how they work and the different things that people can utilize while using a computer. I'm also interested in math and science, basically the entire STEM field because I love using numbers and doing experiments to analyze different things. </p>

    <h1>Experience </h1>
    <p>Over the past few years, I've have taken part in different programs. Here is the timeline of some of those activities.
    <p>From 2014-2017, I played in a intramural basketball league, where I made friends and learned about the value of being on a team. My position on the team was Power Forward/Center, so I very very aggressive and getting a lot of rebounds, and continued to get better every year.<p>
    <p>Next, since 2015, I've been a part of a baseball league that has programs for kids with special needs. I was diagnosed with Autism when I was 2 years old, but I'm on the higher end of the spectrum. However, my younger brother is on the lower end of the spectrum. Anyway, my position on the baseball team is First Base/Catcher. I've also continued to learn how to be a leader and help my fellow teammates do the best they can.<p>
    <p>Now, here are some programs that I did over the last few summers. In 2017, I was in the Youth Police Academy, where we learned lessons from Police Officers and School Safety Agents, had weekly visits from the Distict Attorney, and went on various trips including visiting the courthouse on 161st Street. This was a great experience for me to meet new people and to learn more about safety.</p>
    <p>In 2018, I was in the STEM program (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math). In this program, I learned how to build cool inventions, such as a cardboard ferris wheel, cardboard defribilator and a metal car. I also learned skills such as drilling, gluing and saultering. This was a great experience because it shows how you can bring technology to life. We also went on a sailing trip, where we learned about buoyancy and went on a sailboat and learned about the different aspects of riding it as well as the different parts of the sailboat and what they do. That might have been the best part of the program.</p>
    <p>Last year, in 2019, I participated in a couple of experiences. First, I got accepted for Summer Youth and recieved the opportunity to work in a basketball camp called SWISH Academy. It was a program that was meant for teaching kids how to play basketball. Unfortunately, kids never showed up. However, we did go on community outreaches so we can look for kids, and inform them about the basketball camp. We also had basketball tournaments for kids. Some of the things I did were helping set up the tent for the DJ booth to play music, sweeping the court, as well as doing the scoreboard for the games. Another great part of this was that I got my first work experience and I got paid a good amount of money.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the other experience I had last year was interning at a gym in Queens. I first found out about this because in the baseball league that I'm in, they have a partnership with a fitness program called CJ Turn 2 Fitness. So the trainer, whose name is CJ, gave me a offer to intern for his organization. Some opportunities I got to explore were meeting athletes of all ages that play various sports, helping out with the equipment, such as wiping the weights, helped some of the athletes follow the workout chart, as well as working out on my free time. This experience also helped me gain community service hours for school.</p>
    <p>Lastly, in 2020, I got accepted to a online coding Internship called All Star Code. In this program, I've been learning how to code, using devices like Visual Studio Code, GitBash, as well as GitHub. I've also been taking part in weekly lectures with a mentor, who supports us in what we do in the program and gives us good advice, and attending weekly guest speaking sessions with members from AT&T. This opportunity has really shown me that when things get tough, all you have to do is ask for help, never give up and have a growth mindset. </p>
